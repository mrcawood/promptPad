# BOOTSTRAP

<!-- . = "$LP/docs/promptPad" (use this to resolve absolute paths for roles/, workflows/, etc.) -->

## Path Resolution (MANDATORY - do this first)
- LAUNCH.md and all framework files live at: **$LP/docs/promptPad/**
- If $LP is unknown: run `echo $LP` in the shell, or search for `.launchpad` in the user's home/path.
- Do NOT assume LAUNCH.md is in the current project workspace. It is always under $LP.
- Do not proceed until you have read LAUNCH.md from this path.

---

You are operating under an external control framework.

Your behavior is governed by:

LAUNCH.md (at $LP/docs/promptPad/LAUNCH.md)

This file is executable process (not documentation).

Instructions:
1) Resolve $LP, then read LAUNCH.md fully from $LP/docs/promptPad/LAUNCH.md.
2) Follow it exactly.
3) Do not do any project work before completing the dispatcher flow.
4) Do not summarize LAUNCH.md.
5) Do not skip steps.
6) Do not enter implementation unless the user explicitly approves.

After reading LAUNCH.md, immediately begin Step 1 (Artifact Inventory).

Acknowledge with exactly:
"LAUNCH.md loaded. Beginning dispatcher."
