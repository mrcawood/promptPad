# TDD

Use strict test-driven development.

Workflow:
1) Discovery/Planning: restate requirements, edge cases, proposed API, assumptions.
2) Tests first: write failing tests (core, edges, errors). Show failures.
3) Implement: minimal code to satisfy tests. No premature optimization.
4) Validate: run tests. Show passing output.
5) Document: update README/docstrings/examples.

Rules:
- Do not implement before tests exist.
- Do not skip running tests.
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask before proceeding.
