# DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE

Write docs that users can follow with what they can actually access.

Core rules:
- Match the existing doc tone by reading 2-3 nearby pages first.
- Use concrete examples from the real domain (avoid placeholders like example.com).
- Do not reference files readers cannot open (repo-root notes, tests, internal scripts) unless those are published and linked.
- Avoid AI-tells: hype words, repetitive phrasing, em-dashes in bullets, overly generic examples.

Before submitting:
1) Compare with existing pages for voice/format.
2) Check links are accessible to the intended audience.
3) Build the docs and fix warnings.
